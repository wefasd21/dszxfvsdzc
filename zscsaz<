<div dir="ltr">
<div>1. Always Tell An Adult</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sometimes telling an adult may not seem like the best option because they might bully you more because they think you're a snitch.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Avoid Bullies</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you see a bully you should do your best to avoid them. Stay away from areas that they tend to be with so you could reduce the number of interactions you have with them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. Be Around Friends</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If a bully sees you in a group they will most likely not interact as they will find you less intimidating.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>4. Stay Confident</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you stay confident in front of a bully and tell them to stop they will not be as interested in bullying you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>5.Act Immediately</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The sooner you stop the bully the less power they have. If they keep on bullying you they will start getting more aggressive and will make you more miserable.</div>
